In the search result table, the plugin shows a new column (titled "CSG" by default) that contains status icons denoting whether or not submissions have been given coding style grades.

Click on either the status icon or the new button ([if enabled](../../configuration/#button)) to directly access the coding style grading interface.

If you wish to view the submission before grading it (which is advisable), click on the magnifying glass icon.
